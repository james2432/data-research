**ISCED Levels**
- Elem = (Elementary - 7e-8e) = ISCED = 2
- ConEd = (Continued Education) = ISCED = ?? (Case by case) Can be a range `1-2`
- Sec = (Secondary/Highschool) = ISCED = 3

ISCED Level for continued education is usually for 3 : it runs summer courses, night classes, etc to get your high school diploma (in this case the school is called education permanente), but that school has second language courses for adults, international students(students between 13 and 16) which is usually english or french classes and online courses which help you gain missing credits to earn high school diploma.
